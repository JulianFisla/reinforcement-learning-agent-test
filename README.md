# Reinforcement Learning Agent Test

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms using Python. It tests agent behavior in various environments to evaluate learning performance and adaptation through reward-based training.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** Implements foundational RL techniques such as Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
- **Customizable Environments:** Supports simulation in multiple environments for agent training.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks agent performance and improvements over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for the project.
- **OpenAI Gym:** Used to provide training environments for the agent.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** For building and training neural networks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JulianFisla/reinforcement-learning-agent-test.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Run the training scripts (first the random agent):
  ```bash
  python random_agent.py
  ```

4. Run the training scripts (then the intelligent agent):
  ```bash
  python intelligent_agent.py
  ```

## Known Issues:

1. Some environments may require additional dependencies.
